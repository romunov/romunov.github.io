Sorting windows to appropriate screens and virtual desktops is a hassle. Which is why I really love the sleep feature. The problem was, when I tried to wake the computer up, my secondary screen would not work anymore. Connection is via USB-C, the computer detects it, it's charging over it, but there is no picture. Even in settings, no secondary display was detected. This was solved by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;inxi -Fzx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the picture appeared instantly. Don't ask me how this works, it's just something I tried when I ran diagnostics from &lt;a href="https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/dual-external-monitor-problem-with-fedora-35/19115/4"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roman Lu≈°trik</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 11:03:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:biolitika.si,2022-07-14:/problem-with-secondary-screen-waking-fedora-thinkpad-carbon.html</guid><category>HowTo</category><category>fedora</category><category>thinkpad</category><category>dual screen</category><category>secondary screen</category><category>sleep</category><category>wake-up</category></item></channel></rss>
