Window management was made easy for me using [gTile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/).  A handy accelerator ("key binding") is to tile windows in thirds. This comes especially handy in wider screens where I can tile three windows next to each other. To do this I used `Preset resize`

```
3x1 1:1 1:1, 2:1 2:1, 3:1 3:1
```

If you map this to an accelerator, you will be able to cycle tile window to first, second or third third of the window.
