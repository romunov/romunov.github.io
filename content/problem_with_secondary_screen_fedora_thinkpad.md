If there's anything I really hate is booting up my system every day. Sorting windows to appropriate screens and virtual desktops is a hassle. Which is why I really love the sleep feature. The problem was, when I tried to wake the computer up, my secondary screen would not work anymore. Connection is via USB-C, the computer detects it, it's charging over it, but there is no picture. Even in settings, no secondary display was detected. This was solved by running

```bash
inxi -Fzx
```

and the picture appeared instantly. Don't ask me how this works, it's just something I tried when I ran diagnostics from [this page](https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/dual-external-monitor-problem-with-fedora-35/19115/4).
